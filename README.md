## How To Connect With Your Google Sheet

This website has no demo mode. Login, registration, tests, notes, results, payment links, and access unlock all come from Google Sheets through Apps Script.

1. Open your Google Sheet.
2. Go to Extensions > Apps Script.
3. Paste the full content of `Code.gs` or `apps-script.gs`.
4. Run `setupNursingSolutionSheets` one time and approve permissions.
5. Deploy as Web App:
   - Execute as: Me
   - Who has access: Anyone
6. Copy Web App URL.
7. Open `script.js` and replace `googleAppsScriptUrl` with your new Web App URL.
8. Browser me Web App URL open karke test karein. Response JSON me `ok: true`, `mode: "live"`, aur spreadsheet name dikhna chahiye.

## Test Setting Sheet

Important: `Test Name` must exactly match the `Test Name` in Test Setting.

## Notes Sheet

Use this sheet to add free or paid study notes.

`Note Title`, `Subject`, `Description`, `Note Type`, `File Link`, `Status`, `Access Type`, `Price`, `Razorpay Link`, `Sort Order`

## Access Control Sheet

For paid tests or paid notes, add student access here after payment.

`Email`, `User ID`, `Item Type`, `Item Name`, `Access Status`, `Expiry Date`, `Payment Ref`, `Added Date`

Example:

| Email | User ID | Item Type | Item Name | Access Status | Expiry Date | Payment Ref | Added Date |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| student@gmail.com |  | Test | NORCET Premium Set 01 | Active | 2026-12-31 | pay_xxxx | 2026-06-30 |
| student@gmail.com |  | Note | NORCET Premium Notes | Active | 2026-12-31 | pay_xxxx | 2026-06-30 |

`Item Type` must be `Test` or `Note`.

`Item Name` must exactly match the paid `Test Name` or `Note Title`.

`Access Status` can be `Active`, `Unlocked`, `Paid`, or `Yes`.

## Payment Flow

1. You add Razorpay link in `Test Setting` or `Notes`.
2. Student sees `Pay now`.
3. Student pays on Razorpay.
4. You add the student's email in `Access Control` with `Access Status` as `Active`.
5. Student clicks Refresh or logs in again.
6. Paid item becomes unlocked.

## Important

This setup does not verify Razorpay payments automatically. It is designed for manual access control from Google Sheet. For automatic unlock after payment, you will need a Razorpay webhook endpoint or a stronger backend.

If the website shows a connection error, redeploy Apps Script as a Web App and paste the latest `/exec` URL into `script.js`.

## If Website Says Google Sheet Data Load Nahi Ho Raha

Do these checks in order:

1. Apps Script me `Code.gs` ka full latest code paste karein.
2. `setupNursingSolutionSheets` run karein.
3. Deploy > Manage deployments > Edit > Version: New version > Deploy karein.
4. Deployment access `Anyone` rakhein.
5. Web App URL hamesha `/exec` se end hona chahiye, `/dev` ya editor link nahi.
6. Web App URL browser me open karein. Agar `ok: true` nahi aa raha, issue Apps Script side par hai.
7. Latest `/exec` URL `script.js` ke `googleAppsScriptUrl` me paste karein.
8. Website refresh karein, logout karke dobara login karein.
